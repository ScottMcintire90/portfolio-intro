      <h4><em>Education</em></h4>
        <p>I grew up in Beaverton and went to Westview Highschool. During that time I was an avid participant of Track and Field and excelled at learning the basics of the Japanese language. After graduation in 2009, I moved to Spokane and attended Gonzaga University. There, I received a well-rounded education, focusing my studies on International Relations and the German language. After I finished up in 2013, I traveled a little while, working in Costa Rica for 3 months with my girlfriend before moving back home to Portland and looking for work.</p>


      <h4><em>My Job</em></h4>
        <p>I work as an administrative assistant at Oregon Reproductive Medicine. ORM is a fertility clinic in downtown Portland. We help women become pregnant and couples achieve their dreams of having a family. I spend most of my day in front of a computer working in spreadsheets, typing up reports and sending emails.
        </p>


      <h4><em>My Skills</em></h4>
        <p>I have always had a fascination with languages. It began in high school when I was tasked with choosing a language. I love to be challenged so I went with the language I had heard was the hardest to learn: Japanese. A few years into high school, I decided to connect with my ancestry and teach myself Norwegian. I studied in my spare time, met pen pals from Norway online and eventually became conversationally fluent. During the summer before my Junior I went to Norway for 3 months and met distant relatives and worked at a mountain hotel. In college I continued my linguistic studies with German. So, why programming? I now feel like I want to switch from speaking languages to programming languages. I am testing the waters with this intro course and could already see myself making a career out of this in the future.
